            <p>Calvin Lee was born in <a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topeka,_Kansas">Topeka Ks </a> and raised in<a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junction_City,_Kansas">Junction City, KS</a>. 
                He had delt with asthma his entire life which caused him to not be very physically active because he felt his health condition could not be overcome. 
                With this, he became a bit "heafty" as he would say and any type of physical activity would be exhausting.
                At the age of thirteen, he began his wrestling career and his journey to gain his pride. Even with a loosing 
                streak Calvin continued on and never gave up! With his new active lifestyle he began to notice the changes in himself
                which gave him the conifdence to continue to wrestle all the way through high school. <br/>
                 A couple years after graduating college, Calvin found himself in Afghanistan as a civilian contractor where he worked side by side
                 with the military, helping them repair thier vehicles for missions. In his three years of working, he talked to many soilders
                 who were depressed, each had their own reason and sometimes could not cope with being away from loved ones. He then told them
                 that just a dedicated workout would boost their conifence and hope that exercise would get their mind off stressful events. 
                  His plan was a success and after more changes within himself and helping others change, he came back to the states in 2013
                  with the same goal. Two years later he made PRIDE gym into what it is today and is proud of his success.

            <p class="Lee">The goal</p>
            <p>When Calvin built pride, his goal was to build anybodys confidence through exercise. </p> Himself and his staff, would love to see a smile
            on the faces of customers who walk through the door.
