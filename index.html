                <div class="intro">
        <p>Life is full of stress. Whether it is stress at home, at work, or with family. It is the hussle and 
            bussle of trying to keep up with your current financial, situation your home situation. The 
            point I am trying to make is that life can stress you out and take you down. When life does that, you find it hard 
            to find the strength to keep going, and somtimes that can take a personal toll on you. Some people produce just enough
            energy to continue the monotony of life, and never feel good about themselves for <em>any</em> part of the day.
            When I see someone like this I feel that they have lost their motive to keep going. They have lost the pride they had 
            within themselves.</p>
