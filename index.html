    <p id ="sub">Earn your pride.</p>
    <p>Life is full of stress. Weather it is stress at home, at work, or with family. It is the hussle and 
        bussle of trying to keep up with your current financial, situation your home situation. The 
        point I am trying to make is that life can stress you out and take you down. When life does that, you find it hard 
        to find the strength to keep going, and somtimes that can take a personal toll on you. Some people produce just enough
        energy to continue the monotony of life, and never feel good about themselves for <em>any</em> part of the day.
        When I see someone like this I feel that they have lost their motive to keep going. They have lost the pride they had 
        within themselves.   
    </p>
    <p> I want to help you earn pride back in your life. As your personal trainer, I want to take the amount of time you would
         like to dedicate to yourself and show you that you have the motive to keep going. Decididng to eat healthy and Exercise
         was one of the ways people find this extra strength, and I would like to help you get that extra strenth. I want to help you 
         get your pride back.
